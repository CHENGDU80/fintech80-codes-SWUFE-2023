How to watch Apple's Scary Fast event today October 30,2023/10/31,"Apple is holding an event on October 30 at 8PM ET.  The company’s calling it a “Scary Fast” event,  it's going to announce some improved hardware . 
We already had the big iPhone 15 reveal, so that leaves the company’s desktop and laptop computers. Given the event’s name, it’s highly likely Apple will drop the long-awaited M3 chip. It’s been nearly 17 months since the M2 debuted and, well, Moore’s law and all of that. For reference, it was 19 months between the M1 launch and the M2 debut.
Chips are only as good as the gadgets they power, so there should be a couple of hardware announcements to go along with that “scary fast” M3 chipset. M3-powered MacBook Pro will take center stage at the event.
It’s also high-time that Apple released some new iMacs, as it’s been well over two years since 2021’s colorful refresh. Gurman has reported that the event will likely see the introduction of a new 24-inch iMac, also powered by the rumored M3 chip. He notes that current iMacs are in short supply at retail stores and that this typically indicates a forthcoming upgrade.",Apple
"Apple’s About to Announce M3 Pro, M3 Max, M3 Ultra Systems: Report",2023/10/31,"Configs of Apple’s new Macs (up to 32 cores and 80 GPU clusters) seemingly leak ahead of launch.
Apple is poised to refresh its Mac lineup in an upcoming online-only event?called 'Scary Fast,'?with a focus on introducing new MacBook Pros and iMacs equipped with the latest M3-series?processors, reports?Bloomberg.?The?'Scary Fast'?description of the event might indicate that we will be dealing with high-performance M3 Pro and M3 Max processors produced on one of TSMC's N3 process technologies.
In the spotlight are the anticipated MacBook Pros, which are set to undergo significant internal enhancements. These new models are projected to house the advanced M3 Pro and M3 Max processors, marking a?rather?substantial leap from the previous M2-series. The processors have undergone?a?rigorous?upgrade and gained both general-purpose cores and graphics clusters, as shown in the table.
The iMac is also reportedly slated for an update, marking its first in over 900 days. While the external design is expected to retain its current aesthetics, the internals will see a revamp. The new models are predicted to feature Apple's M3 chip, coupled with improved GPU configurations and a transition to USB-C connectors, signifying a modernization of the iMac’s architecture.",Apple
Could ASML Stock Help You Retire A Millionaire?,2023/10/30,"The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker has a bright future.
ASML?(ASML?-0.14%)?was founded nearly four decades ago, and it gradually evolved into a linchpin of the global chip market. The Dutch semiconductor equipment maker is currently the world's largest manufacturer of lithography systems, which semiconductor manufacturers use to etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers.
It's also the world's only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems, which are required to produce the world's smallest and densest chips. It doesn't face any competitors because ASML perfected its EUV technology over the past three decades, its systems cost about $200 million each and require multiple planes to ship, and the top foundries -- including?Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC),?Samsung, and?Intel?-- all use its EUV systems.
 
ASML has had a great run over the past decade, but a few?major challenges?could still impede its long-term growth. One major issue is China, which accounted for 14% of its sales in 2022 and remains locked in an escalating tech war with the U.S. and Europe. ASML has been barred from shipping its EUV systems to China since 2019, but a new round of tighter export curbs will prevent it from shipping its higher-end DUV systems to Chinese chipmakers next year. Those bans are also driving Chinese chipmakers to explore new ways to produce smaller chips -- and any major breakthroughs could abruptly loosen ASML's iron grip on the high-end lithography market.",ASML
Women run up against judgement culture at ASML,2023/10/30,"On Thursday, Studio040 published its first article in which female employees at ASML say they are discriminated against in the workplace. But women at the high-tech company also feel undervalued in other ways, Studio040’s research shows. For instance, women are less likely to be promoted and find it difficult to speak out about things that are not going well.Far more women than men seek help from union members if they have problems with managers or ASML itself. Of those who seek help from a union member at the Veldhoven-based chip machine manufacturer, between 70 and 80 per cent are women, the FNV says. That is a high number for a company where 80 per cent of employees are men.
Converted, this makes a woman more than 10 times more likely to seek help for problems with the Veldhoven employer than a man. Annually, dozens of people in the company turn to the union for help.",ASML
AI in the cloud: Microsoft boosts share; Amazon predicts ‘tens of billions’ in new revenue,2023/10/30,"AI is starting to generate real money for the big cloud providers.
Global spending on cloud infrastructure services topped $68 billion in the third quarter, up 18% year-over-year. That’s the new estimate from Synergy Research Group, a market researcher that provides data and analysis on IT and cloud-related markets, after results last week from Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
“The current economic and political climate has crimped some growth in cloud spending, but there is clear evidence that generative AI technology and services are starting to help overcome those barriers,” Synergy Research said.",Microsoft
UPDATED: Microsoft To Invest $1 Billion In Data Center in Floyd County,2023/10/31,"Microsoft announced that it will invest $1 billion in a data center campus off Huffaker Road during a Rome Floyd County Development Authority meeting this morning. 
The project, dubbed Project Firecracker, encompasses a 347 acre property on Huffaker Road which Microsoft will purchase at $40,000 per acre. The authority voted to issue $1 billion in industrial revenue bonds in the project alongside a 12 year partial tax abatement.
Those bonds allow the authority to essentially act as a go between for the seller and Microsoft.Microsoft will pay property taxes as well as county school taxes on the increased value of the property. The abatements only cover the buildings on the property as well as equipment that will go on the property. The 12 year abatement will include the buildings and a 9 year abatement will include equipment that will go into the data center. ",Microsoft
Nvidia-backed startup Seurat hints at IPO after $99 million fundraise,2023/10/30,"3D metal-printing startup Seurat Technologies on Monday hinted at potentially going public in the medium-term and said it had raised $99 million in a funding round co-led by chip designer Nvidia's (NVDA.O) venture capital arm.
